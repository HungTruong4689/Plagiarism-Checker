This curve-fitting algorithm helps recognizing various strokes of different patterns (line, quadratic curve) precisely. This reduces the error elimination burden heavily.

       " 'With the rapid growth and advancement of the use of computers in Bangladesh, the use of our mother tongue, Bengali in computers is being much talked about and much research is being done. As we find in many cases, the problem of input of Bengali characters to computers is time consuming and error prone. One answer to the problem would be the development of a practical Bengali character recognition method towards which the efforts of this project is directed. The objective of this research is the development of a method for the recognition of hand written Bengali characters using the syntactic method.',\n",
       " ' After several decades of research activities, hand written character recognition still retains its appeal as an exciting and growing field of scientific investigation. Handwritten Character Recognition (HCR) [20] is the reading of a scanned image of a hand written character along with an associated lexicon. The domain of hand written character verification varies form applications in reading handwritten addresses in post mail, reading Bank checks, or extracting some data from diverse forms. Depending on the chosen language different techniques can be applied for different types of characters. The Syntactic method [5,13,14] is a well developed approach to recognize the characters of different Latin-based languages while suffers from the drawback of recognizing Bengali hand written characters properly.',\n",
       " 'The largest difficulty of handwritten Bengali character recognition is the immense variation of the way handwriting. Many factors can account for the diversity in Bengali handwriting styles, among others the regional origin of the writers; their educational level and their profession In fact different circumstances such as stress; fatigue; and hurry affect the handwriting of any individual. In this paper, a new algorithm to identify various strokes of handwritten characters is proposed. It is a curve-fitting based algorithm, which helps to recognize various strokes of different patterns (line, quadratic curve) with high accuracy. Figure.1 depicts our proposed Modified Syntactic Method (MSM) system, which consists of four components. In the first component the strokes are generated. We differentiate between curve and line stroke, as we will discuss later. In the reference characters database components, character elements are entered at a time in scanned style, pre-processed, and then stored in a reference character database. In then curvature analysis to differentiate curves and lines and string generation component, a numeric string type code is generated which uniquely identifies the character from the structural representation of a character. In the last and final component, we get the result depending on the previous ‚code™ (Reference Component) the machine takes decision to the class ',\n",

(It is not mandatory to produced 48x48 dimension pixels. We use this dimension because produced reference database is in 48x48 pixel. We can also use any dimension for operational flexibility.) This process proceeds by scanning alternately from left to right and top to bottom along various rows and columns of the input array. This continues until a black byte is encountered. A byte is taken as black if it has more than one black points. In Figure 4 scanned image of the letter Ka(K) is shown. To recognize a given character, at first it is to be digitized into a matrix i.e. to be transformed into a binary form for ease of handling by the computer. The digitizer is a device, which converts a physical sample to be recognized into a pattern vector.

If a discontinuous occurs, scanning proceeds to the next line with the assumption that the void in the current line is due to improper scanning. If the next line gives continuity, a black point is assumed in the previous line and its coordinates are saved. Otherwise, the stroke is assumed to have terminated. All black points (1) of the stroke [15] are terminated out to ‚0™ during the time the coordinates are storing so that these are not considered again when scanning starts from the upper left corner for the next stroke.

The first step in this procedure is the selection of strokes and the generation of code for each stroke in a character.  3.4.1 Selection of Strokes  In syntactic method each input pattern is to be resolved into primitive structural elements called strokes [15]. The first step in designing a syntactic model is the selection of morphs in terms of which the patterns of interest can be represented. In selecting strokes care must be taken so that they are simple to recognize and they are minimum in number.',\n",

The stroke under consideration is either a curve or a straight line with the theme that any alphabet in any language can be represented by combination of curves or straight lines. The challenge in this process lies in what degree we are breaking an alphabet. Later the co-ordinates of continuous strokes are fitted for finding numeric codes.  ',\n",

But the techniques developed for resolving each character into a number of stokes [18,21], their recognition lead to a new approach. However, the idea of representation of characters by numeric codes for their recognition was proposed and successfully used before in recognizing foreign letters and now also in Bengali characters.  The principal difficulty with this approach is the lack of use of a nearness criterion. If a character sample produces a code different from all known codes, it is rejected.',\n",

       " '274solution to this problem, some of the characters have been assigned several codes, corresponding to common discrepancies between character samples due to a lack of uniformity in quality of handwriting. Improvements in resolution would also be expected to help.  The ideal goal of designing a hand writing recognition method with 100% accuracy is illusionary, because even human beings are not able to recognize every handwritten text without any doubt, e.g. it happens to most people that they sometimes cannot even read their own notes. Humans roughly recognize 96%[23].',\n",
       " ' By considering the curve fitting with curvature [3], the performance can be surprisingly improved. This technique is not applicable to the recognition of the handwritten characters of children or old but for the adults. Our method proved to be useful, as it was successful in recognition of about 95% of the characters.  By using this technique, Bengali numeric characters can also be recognized. With some modifications one can also recognize the compound words, which includes both characters and numerals [30]. Examples of which are postal code recognition, number plate of car recognition etc. A complete Bengali document can be recognized with better improvement of this technique. Several possibilities exist which could improve the chances of constructing a practical text recognition device [5,24].a) High standard of scanning quality. b) Stylized character [23,24,25] size. and c) Language simplification. The problem would be the development of a practical Bengali character recognition machine, toward which the effort of this project is directed. It is hope that advances in this area would provide additional incentive for work in translation devices.',\n",
       " ' 5.5 Recommendations for Future Work  We have developed our system for single Bengali character recognition. Every character cannot be recognized with this technique. But with some modification this can be done. We have also the following recommendation for future work:  1. The percentage of recognition can be improved by dynamically assigning edit distances, the weights of insertion, deletion and substitution values by using the training process.',\n",
       " '2. We did not use the positional information of the string numbers. Use of this information could prove to be beneficial. 3. This method can also be used to recognize Bengali numerals.',\n",
       " '4. This method can also be used for the recognition of postal code, car plate number where compound structure of alphabet and numerals present.',\n",
       " '5. Regression analysis [9] with curvature analysis can improve the performance of recognition process. 6. For an alphabet with large number of characters this method may not be effective as it was for Bengali alphabet. In those cases this method could be used as a pre-classifier to aid the actual recognition process. 7. Signatures can be recognized by improving this technique also.',\n",
