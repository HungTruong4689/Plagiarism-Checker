Fig.2 Block Diagram of SoC Wire Codec 
Design of SoC Wire Codec 
The SoCWire CODEC connects a node or host system to a 
SoCWire network. It consists of six modules. 
•     State machine 
•     Receiver 
•     Receiver FIFO 
•     Transmitter  
•     Transmitter FIFO 
•     Dual port Ram 
The  state  machine  controls  the  overall  operation  of  the  link 
interface. It provides link initialization, normal operation and error recovery services. The operation of the state machine is described 
in the form of a state diagram given below. Transmitter  FIFO  can  be  access  with  the  low  active  data  write 
signal. As soon as the FIFO is full the data full signal is ‘1’. FCTs 
received by the receiver are forwarded with the fct write signal to 
the transmitter. The fct_write increments the credit counters. If the 
credit counter receives 7 FCTs the fct_full signal is set. For a bi-
directional full-duplex transfer the FCTs have to be included in the 
data  transfer.  The  tx  FIFO  does  not  require  a  dedicated  ram, 
because  it  just  has  to  store  1  data  word.  There  is  one  Special 
condition while making this block is Signal Swallow. Swallow ‘1’ 
means  transmitter  will  not  receive  (read)  the  data  from  tx-FIFO 
.Therefore  data_empty  must  be  1when  swallow  is  1.it  is  one  for 
non run state.
